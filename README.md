I picked up an inexpensive lightning detector sensor based on the AS3925 integrated circuit on a small circuit board from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) (_where i spend too much money ;-)_) and attached it to one of my Raspberry Pi's that I had sitting around. I then installed my software ([see my detector project](https://github.com/ironsheep/lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon)) to talk to the AS3935 on the RPi and forward what it detected to my MQTT broker which was then forwarded on to my Home Assistant installation. This Lovelace Card provides a means to display this lighting detector data in an easily interpreted form.

### Where to get the AS3935 sensor board

Please visit my sensor project for detail on how/where to get the sensor and for the software needed to send the data to Home Assistant. [See my [lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon](https://github.com/ironsheep/lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon) project.]

## About this card

This is a Lovelace card showing you lightning in your local area **as detected by your own inexpensive sensor**. The card has range-rings that when colored indicate that lightning was detected at that range. There are additional details describing when the detections first started (Storm began) how frequent and how stong the detections are (relative power).

With this card you can see a storm approach and how strong it is and when it leaves. You'll also see storm details such as when it started and when it ended.

Here are a couple videos showing the card in action:

## Installation

Use [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) (recommended)
or download _lightning-detector-card.js_ from our [Latest Release](https://github.com/ironsheep/lovelace-lightning-detector-card/releases/latest) and place it in your www directory.

In your ui-lovelace.yaml (or resources.yaml, whichever you use for resources) add this:

```yaml
- url: /hacsfiles/lovelace-lightning-detector-card/lightning-detector-card.js
  type: module
```

If you don't use HACS please change the url accordingly.

## Config

| Name  | Type   | Default       | Description  |
| ----- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| title | string | {sensor name} | Common title |

### Sensor settings affecting this display

The Lightning MQTT Daemon sends some settings to this card. These settings are:

| Name                    | Type   | Default | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| period_in_minutes       | number | 5       | display detections during this period.                               |
| number_of_rings         | number | 5       | number of rings [3-7]                                                |
| distance_as             | string | km      | distance units [km, mi]                                              |
| end_storm_after_minutes | number | 30      | mark storm ended after no further detections during this end period. |

To change any of these you'll want to modify the _config.ini_ for your sensor and restart it. This card will then automatically pick up the new values.
